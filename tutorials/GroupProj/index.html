                You and your friends wake up from your tents after drinking around a campfire the night before. You are out in the wilderness
                hoping to gain some bonding time with people you haven't been able to meet up with in a while. After a quick breakfast, you 
                are ready to head out to go hunting and make some new experiences.

                        <br> <br> It takes hours before you see your first herd of deer. You and your friends successfully take down the dear

                                You and your buddies drop the dear, completely forgeting about it, and rush to the treeline into a small meadow of grass and flowers. 
                                You look and see a plumes of smoke rising with hints of yellow flames pushing just above the trees. What you feared seams to be true as 
                                the raging <strong>fire</strong> appears to be in the same direction of where your campsite is. 
                                <br><br> You and your friends race through the forest towards your cars that were parked around 2 miles away from the campsite.
                                by the time you make it to your cars you can start to see the fire in the treeline making its way towards you at an alarming rate. You

                            You manage to score a rabbit this time. Not as impressive as the dear, but still a good hunt nevertheless.
                            <br><br> After adding the rabbit to the stick that was carrying the dear, you and your friends begin your travel back 
                            towards the campsite. On your way back, you start to smell smoke and look to the sky to see that the once clear blue skies blanketed 
                            in a dark grey haze of smoke and ash. Your group drop your hunted animals and rush to a nearby meadow to see a raging fire that has 
                            engulfed the area around where your campsite used to be.

                                                ball turned into a nightmare as multiple embers did not disappear back into the night sky as they usually do. Some end up landing in

                                You decide to wait for the fire to cool down just in case and let you friends go on without you. After a couple of hours, the 
                                smoke from the campfire has stopped and the embers are nothing more than charcoal and ash. You have a faint memory of where 
                                your friends said they were going.

                                    You decide it is better not to test your memory and wait it out until your friends get back. Hours later, your friends 
                                    return with a dear hog tied to a branch and smiles on their faces. They tell you stories of their travel along with the failures 
                                    of how they missed the first shot. <strong><a href="good-ending.html"> It seemed like a lot of fun and you are sad that you

                                        You decide that waiting around for your friends to come back would be boring and don't want to be left out of all the fun so 
                                        you decide to start heading in the direction you saw them leave and try to follow the lightly pressed foot prints in the ground.
                                        <br> <br> After an hour of tracking, the foot steps become to faint to recognize anymore. You are deep within the forest now with 
                                        no real clue of where they went to next.

                                                You move further into the forest losing sight of any footprints as the forest floor fills in with dense grasses and plants. After 
                                                a while you find yourself completely lost within a tall grass meadow with zero clue to where your friends might be. Any form of 
                                                clue to help you get back is long gone and you start to panic. After screaming for help for a couple of minutes, you try to think 
                                                of a way to get out of this mess. One thing that pops into your head is creating a smoke signal out of the surrounding brush in 
                                                the hopes that someone will see it.

                                                    After gathering enough twigs, leaves, and branches, you start a small fire and continue. As you throw in some more leaves to 
                                                    try and increase the amount of smoke from the fire, the wind picks up causing the fire to gain a lot of oxygen making the 
                                                    flames rapidly grow to unsustainable heights. The surrounding grass bed catches <strong><a href="bad-ending Cedar.html"> multiple flying embers in the process and 
                                                    begin to ignite into monstorous flames. </a></strong> You run back into the forrest to escape the fire. 
                                                    <br> <br> Hours later, a helicopter responding to the massive fire you unintentially started spots you and rescues you. Although this 
                                                    was not what you were thinking about when making a signal fire, it did end up getting you out of being stranded.

                                            campsite using the same foot prints from earlier and wait for your friends to return back. Hours later, your friends

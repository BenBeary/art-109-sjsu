    <p>      according to the "National Parks Sevice" humans cause 
        85 percent of all wildfires in the United States. The scenarios you participated in 
        were based on real-life California wildfires and the decisions individuals made
        that resulted in these outcomes. If you are seeing this page it means that you chose to 
        make better choices than the individuals that caused these fires. Hopefully, this simulation will 
        help you be more aware of how your choices could result in a wildfire and help raise awareness about wildfires.</p>

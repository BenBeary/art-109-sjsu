                <summary>My Thoughts</summary>
                <p> Video games have gained a lot of popularity with technology continuing to advance. Games have have
                    been
                    a way to grow new communities on the internet and meet new people. They have also been able to help
                    releave stress by taking people outside of the real world to forget about their problems for a bit.
                    This
                    is a double edge sword however as people can tend to spend too much time playing video games causing
                    them to get locked in a loop of never exploring the outside world. Game Developers tend to not try
                    and
                    fix this problem as their entire goal for making games is to make it so the player is fully emersed
                    in
                    the virtual world that they have created, further adding to the problem.</p>

                <p> Even with that said, my addiction to video games knows no bounds and I too shall join the game
                    developers that have sucked away hours of peoples' lives into playing a virtual game that holds zero
                    status in the real world.</p>

                                                        Hi I am Ben, and I want to go into level design for game development in hopes of creating cool 
                                                        and interesting worlds for people to play in. I am a 5th year student here, well tecnically I 
                                                        have only been here 3 years now as I transfered from a Community College up in Sonoma County. 
                                                        Living in the city is a very different pace than I am used too but it has not been as bad as I 
                                                        thought it would turn out.
